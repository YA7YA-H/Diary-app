**MY DIARY Api:** version 1.0

<h2>MY DIARY</h2>

A simple api for My Diary app <br>
MyDiary is an online journal where users can pen down their thoughts and feelings.
The my diary api has been beautifully designed with a endpoints functionalities that include:
creation of new user account, creation of new entries, viewing of entries, updating of entries, deletion of entries,


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

python 3.6
<br>
psql (PostgreSQL) 10.4
<br>
A working web browser and or a pc.
<br>
If you wish to clone the repo please satisfy the requirements in the requirements.txt


## Installing

```
install python language (preferably version 3.6)

clone the repo to your desktop/laptop

git clone https://github.com/YA7YA-H/DIARY.git

## install and run a development environment

apt-get install virtualenv -p python3 venv
apt-get install -f

##Database Ensure that postgresql is up and running on localhost command linux:
service postgresql start

Create a postgresql database called mydiarydb.
 Navigate to configurations/config.py configure the database variable in sqlalchemy_database_uri to your database user details example:
    DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get(
        'DATABASE_URL', "postgresql://postgres:hassan@localhost/mydiarydb")

```


<ol>
<h4> Navigate to the cloned repo </h4>
Navigate to the local host with your favorite browser
enjoy
<li> Activate your virtual environment </li>
<p><code>$ source venv/bin/activate</code></p>
<li> You should now see an virtual (venv) environment inside and install </li>
<p><code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt</code></p>
</ol>

## Running the Server
*Inside the virtualenv*
<br>
Start the server at localhost:5000 by running the following command:
```
python3 run.py
```


<span>you should now see a local host ```127.0.0.1:5000```
. Navigate to the local host and you should see a beautiful documentation of
flask restplus of an API with endpoints
</span>

<h3>Running  the test</h3>

<p>Testing has been implemented using the unit testing framework of the Python language. To run tests, use the following command:</p>
<p><code>$ pytest</code></p>

```
#run
pip3 install pytest

pytest /path/to/repo

### Breaking down the tests
These tests ensure Users are registered login credentials are secure, entries are created and are able to be modified
example below

    def test_api_get_entries_without_token(self):
        """Test get entries without token"""
        response = self.client.get(
            'api/v1/user/entries',
            data=json.dumps(self.data),
            content_type="application/json")
        result = json.loads(response.data)
        self.assertEqual(result['Message'],
                         "Unauthorized, access token required!")
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 401)

### test for coverage
run this command in your terminal
coverage run --source=Api_v1.app.app -m pytest  && coverage report

```

<h3>Test Example</h3>

## Need for test

To ensure maintainability of code in future developments
This ensures no new code breaks our already existing code

Note: Travis-ci ensures continous integration and runs test automatically for this build

## Deployment
